# MAGIC # Building Personalized Image Generation Model
# MAGIC Today, design professionals across various industries are harnessing latent diffusion models to generate images that serve as inspiration for their next product designs. This solution accelerator provides Databricks users with a tool to expedite the end-to-end development of personalized image generation applications. The asset including a series of notebooks demonstrates how to preprocess training images, fine-tune a text-to-image diffusion model, manage the fine-tuned model, and deploy the model behind an endpoint and make it available for downstream applications. The solution is by design customizable (bring your own images) and scalable leveraging Databricks powerful distributed compute.

# MAGIC ## Cluster configuration
# MAGIC We recommend using a cluster with the following specifications to run the solution accelerator:
# MAGIC - Unity Catalog enabled cluster 
# MAGIC - Databricks Runtime 14.3LTS ML
# MAGIC - Single-node multi-GPU cluster: e.g. `g5.48xlarge` on AWS or `Standard_NC48ads_A100_v4` on Azure Databricks.
